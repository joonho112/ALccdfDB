\title{Clean raw program data}
\usage{
program_clean(raw_obj, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_obj}{An \code{alccdf_program_raw} object from
\code{\link{program_read}}}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages? Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
An \code{alccdf_program_clean} S3 object
}
\description{
Applies a comprehensive cleaning pipeline to an \code{alccdf_program_raw}
object. All cleaning steps are logged for reproducibility. Produces output
consistent with the established \code{all_programs_appended_cleaned}
protocol, including proper R factor levels for categorical variables and
analysis-ready derived variables.
}
\details{
The cleaning pipeline applies the following operations in order:
\enumerate{
\item Standardise addresses (facility_address, physical_address)
\item Create facility_address2 (further standardised)
\item Parse expiration_date and compute days_till_expire
\item Parse time fields and create datetime versions
\item Convert capacities to integer + derive capacity variables
\item Parse age ranges with binary age-group indicators
\item Compute operating hours (day/night) + operation type
\item Recode facility_tier as ordered factor (Star 1--5) with quality metrics
\item Standardise county as factor (67 Alabama counties)
\item Set region as factor
\item Assign facility_type factor using raw data values (preserves
Family Home vs Group Home distinction)
\item Convert children_under_12mo to integer
}
}
