\usage{
alccdf_synthetic_programs(n = 50, seed = 42)

alccdf_synthetic_subsidy(n_enrolled = 80, n_clients = 40, seed = 42)

alccdf_synthetic_staff(n = 60, seed = 42)

alccdf_synthetic_melissa(programs = NULL, seed = 42)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of staff records. Default 60.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default 42.}

\item{n_enrolled}{Integer. Number of enrolled-children records. Default 80.}

\item{n_clients}{Integer. Number of client records. Default 40.}

\item{programs}{An optional \code{alccdf_program_clean} object. If
\code{NULL} (default), uses \code{alccdf_synthetic_programs(seed = seed)}
to generate addresses.}
}
\value{
An \code{alccdf_program_clean} S3 object.

A named list with \code{$enrolled} and \code{$clients}, each an
\code{alccdf_subsidy_clean} S3 object with \code{$data}, \code{$pii},
and \code{$meta} components.

An \code{alccdf_staff_clean} S3 object with \code{$data},
\code{$pii}, and \code{$meta} components.

A named list with:
\describe{
\item{programs}{A tibble with geocoded program addresses}
\item{households}{A tibble with geocoded household addresses}
}
}
\description{
These functions create realistic synthetic datasets that mirror
the structure and types of real Alabama CCDF administrative data. They are
useful for demonstrations, vignettes, and testing without requiring access
to confidential data files.

All four generators share facility identities when called with the same
\code{seed}, enabling cross-module linkage (programs <-> enrolled <->
clients, programs <-> staff, programs <-> melissa).

Creates a synthetic \code{alccdf_program_clean} object with
realistic facility characteristics, capacity, operating hours, tier
ratings, and derived quality-adjusted capacity fields.

Creates synthetic enrolled-children and clients subsidy data
with PII separation, realistic dates, and cross-module facility linkage.

Creates a synthetic \code{alccdf_staff_clean} object with
staff professional data, career lattice levels, and PII separation.
Uses facility names as the linkage key back to programs.

Creates synthetic Melissa.com geocoding results for both
program addresses and household (client) addresses. Returns plain
tibbles (not S3 objects) matching the structure produced by
\code{\link{melissa_import_programs}} and
\code{\link{melissa_import_households}}.
